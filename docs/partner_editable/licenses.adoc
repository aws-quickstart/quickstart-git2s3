The Quick Start provides an Amazon API Gateway endpoint and several Lambda functions to handle the download, zipping, and deployment of code to Amazon S3. AWS CodePipeline carries a cost for each active pipeline; see https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/pricing/[AWS CodePipeline pricing]. Depending on your configuration, the Quick Start may deploy an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key; for pricing, see https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/[AWS Key Management Service pricing]. API Gateway, Amazon S3, and Lambda costs vary depending on how often you commit code to your repository; each commit triggers a request to the Lambda execution in API Gateway; for details, see the pricing pages for https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/[API Gateway], https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/[Amazon S3], and https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/[Lambda].
