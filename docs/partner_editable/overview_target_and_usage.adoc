Git webhooks enable event-driven integration between Git services and external applications. This Quick Start deploys the HTTPS endpoint and code you can use to configure webhooks linking your AWS and Git services. With this integration in place, each time a Git user pushes a commit, your repository is automatically retrieved, zipped, and uploaded to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. You can then configure AWS services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy to use the S3 bucket as a source. In this way, you can build a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on the foundation this Quick Start deploys.

This guide describes the components that are deployed by the Quick Start, and contains links to launch the AWS CloudFormation template that automates the deployment.
