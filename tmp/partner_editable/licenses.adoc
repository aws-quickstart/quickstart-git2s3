The Quick Start provides an Amazon API Gateway endpoint, Lambda functions, and an AWS CodeBuild project to access, compress, and upload code to Amazon S3. AWS CodePipeline carries a cost for each active pipeline. (See https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/pricing/[AWS CodePipeline pricing].) 

Depending on your configuration, the Quick Start may deploy an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key which incurs a monthly cost for key storage and usage. (See https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/[AWS Key Management Service pricing].) 

API Gateway, Amazon S3, Lambda, and AWS CodeBuild costs vary depending on how often you commit code to the connected Git repository. (See https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/[Amazon API Gateway pricing], https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/[Amazon S3 pricing], https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/[AWS Lambda pricing] and https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/pricing/[AWS CodeBuild pricing].)
